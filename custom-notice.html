            <h2>What is TOR?</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="https://2019.www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en">The
                    Tor network</a> is run by some 5000 volunteers who use the
                free
                software provided by the Tor Project to run Tor routers.
                Client connections are routed through multiple relays, and are
                multiplexed together on the connections between relays.
                The system does not record logs of client connections or
                previous
                hops.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is because the Tor network is a censorship resistance,
                privacy,
                and anonymity system used by <a

                    blowers, journalists,
                    Chinese
                    dissidents skirting the Great Firewall, abuse victims,
                    stalker
                    targets, the US military, and law enforcement,</a> just to
                name a
                few.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, some people misuse the network. However, compared
                to
                the rate of legitimate use (the IP range in question processes
                nearly a gigabit of traffic per second), <a
                    href="https://support.torproject.org/abuse/">abuse

            <h2>Why May Administrators See This IP in Their Logs?</h2>
            <p>
                If you are an administrator or run a website, you may see the IP
                address of a TOR exit relay in your server logs when users
                access
                your website through the TOR network. This happens because the
                last
                node in the TOR network, known as the exit relay, is responsible
                for
                sending the user's request to the intended website on the
                regular
                internet. As a result, your website's server logs will record
                the IP
                address of the TOR exit relay, not the original user's IP
                address.<br>
                <b>It is essential to understand that while the IP address in
                    the
                    logs
                    belongs to the TOR exit relay, the actual user remains
                    anonymous
                    as
                    their original IP address is hidden behind multiple layers
                    of
                    encryption and relay nodes.</b>
            </p>
            <h2>Why Administrators Shouldn't Block TOR Exit Node IPs</h2>
            <p>
                Blocking TOR exit node IPs might seem like a tempting solution
                to
                prevent potential abuse or security threats, but it can have
                unintended consequences and hinder legitimate user access. Here
                are
                some key reasons why administrators should reconsider blocking
                TOR
                exit node IPs:
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Preserving User Anonymity:</b><br>
                TOR is designed to provide online
                anonymity for its users. By blocking TOR exit node IPs,
                administrators may inadvertently deny access to users who rely
                on
                TOR for genuine privacy and security concerns. People in
                repressive
                regimes, journalists, whistleblowers, and activists often use
                TOR to
                access information safely and communicate without fear of
                surveillance.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Maintaining Internet Freedom:</b><br>Embracing TOR and
                allowing its
                users
                access fosters an open and free internet. Blocking TOR exit
                nodes
                could be seen as an attempt to restrict the flow of information
                and
                impede the principles of a decentralized and open web.
            </p>
            <h2>What can administrators do instead of blocking this exit relay?</h2>
            <p>
                The Tor Project provides an automated DNSRBL for you to query to
                flag posts coming from Tor nodes as requiring special review.
                You can also use <a
                    href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/tordnsel.html.en">this
                    DNSRBL</a> to only allow Tor IPs to read but
                not
                post comments.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, be aware that this may be just one jerk amongst many
                legitimate Tor users who use your forums.
                You might have luck getting rid of this jerk by temporarily
                limiting
                account creation to require Gmail accounts before posting, or by
                requiring account creation be done over non-Tor before posting.

                In general, we believe that problems like this are best solved
                by
                improving your service to defend against the attack from the
                Internet at large.
                Brute force login attempts can be reduced/slowed by Captchas,
                which
                is the approach taken by Gmail for this same problem.
                In fact, <a

                deal
